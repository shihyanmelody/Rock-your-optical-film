# Rock-your-optical-film
This website is developed to play around the optical materials. You can explore the optical properties (e.g. refractive index, reflection) of common materials, establish your own optical films, and optimize the design given conditions (the set of coating materials you can use, min and max wavelength range, type of materials, maximum thickness, etc.)
